The shell is a program that takes keyboard commands and passes them to the OS to carry out.
Almost all Linux distributions supply a shell program from the GNU Project called bash (Bourne Again Shell).
We need another program called a terminal emulator (or simply the terminal) to interact with the shell.

If the last character of the shell prompt is # it either means root user or the user has admin privilages. If the last characer is $ then its not root user.

Simple commands
