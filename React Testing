Jest and React Testing Library

Jest
Jest is a javascript testing framework.
Jest is a test runner that finds tests, runs the tests, determines whether the tests passed or failed and reports it back in a human readable manner.

React Testing Library
RTL is a javascript utility that provides virtual DOM for testing react components.
React Testing Library provides a virtual DOM which we can use to interact with and verify the behavour of a react component.

Types of Tests
- Unit tests
  Focus is on testing the individual building blocks of an application such as a class or a function or a component.
  Each unit or building block is tested in isolation, independent of other units.
  Dependencis are mocked.
  
- Integration tests
  Focus is on testing a combination of units and ensuring they work together.
  Take longer than unit tests.
  
- E2E tests
  Focus is on testing the entire application flow and ensuring it works as designed from start to finish.
  Involves in a real UI, a real backend database, real services etc
  Take the longest as they cover the most amount of code
