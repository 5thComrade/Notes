Jest and React Testing Library

Jest
Jest is a javascript testing framework.
Jest is a test runner that finds tests, runs the tests, determines whether the tests passed or failed and reports it back in a human readable manner.

React Testing Library
RTL is a javascript utility that provides virtual DOM for testing react components.
React Testing Library provides a virtual DOM which we can use to interact with and verify the behavour of a react component.

Types of Tests
- Unit tests
  Focus is on testing the individual building blocks of an application such as a class or a function or a component.
  Each unit or building block is tested in isolation, independent of other units.
  Dependencis are mocked.
  
- Integration tests
  Focus is on testing a combination of units and ensuring they work together.
  Take longer than unit tests.
  
- E2E tests
  Focus is on testing the entire application flow and ensuring it works as designed from start to finish.
  Involves in a real UI, a real backend database, real services etc
  Take the longest as they cover the most amount of code
  

To run a test using Jest, first create a test file <FileName>.test.js
In the file we use a method by Jest called 'test'
- test
  test accepts 3 parameters
  test(name, fn, timeout)
  The first argument is the test name used to identify the test
  The second argument is a function that contains the expectations to test
  The third argument is timeout which is optional argument for specifying how long to wait before aborting the test. The default timeout value is
  5 seconds.
 
- render
  render is a method from the react testing library.
  render(<App />)
  The above code will create a virtual dom and render the App component.
  
- screen
  screen is a object from the react testing library
  render(<App />);
  const linkElement = screen.getByText('Learn React');
  
  The above code will render the App component on the virtual dom and use the screen object method 'getByText' to query the virtual dom for the link element
  
- expect
  expect is also a method from Jest library.
  We use expect to check our expectations from the test.
  expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
