Types of Outputs

1: Classification - The value of our labels belong to a discrete set Eg: Pass/Fail, Spam/Not Spam, Aadhar/ Not Aadhar
2: Regression - The value of our labels belong to a continuous set Eg: $0 - $50, 60kg - 80kg


Problem Solving Process
1: Identify data that is relevant to the problem
2: Assemble a set of data related to the problem you're trying to solve
3: Decide on the type of output you are predicting
4: Based on type of output, pick an algorithm that will determine a correlation between your 'feature' and 'labels'
5: Use model generated by algorithm to make a prediction

If any of the features changes, it will affect the labels
Find all the features and find all the labels
