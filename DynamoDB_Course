Data types in DynamoDB
- Scalar types
  - Exactly one value
  - eg: string, number, binary, boolean, and null
  - keys or index attributes only support string, number and binary scalar types
- Set types
  - Multiple scalar values
  - eg: string set, number set and binary set
- Document types
  - Complex structure with nested attributes
  - eg: list and map
  
DynamoDB Consistency Model
  - Strong consistency
    The most up-to-date data
    Must be requested explicitly
    
  - Eventual Consistency
    May or may not reflect the latest copy of data
    Default consistency for all operations
    50% cheaper
