NextJS 13

Pre-rendering
By default, NextJS pre-renders every page. This means that NextJS generates HTML for each page in advance, instead of having it all done by client-side JavaScript.
Each generated HTML is associated with minimal JavaScript code necessary for that page. When a page is loaded by the browser, its JavaScript code runs and makes the page
fully interactive. This process is called hydration.

Two forms of pre-rendering
- Static Generation: The HTML is generated at build time and will be reused on each request.
- Server-side rendering: The HTML is generated on each request.
