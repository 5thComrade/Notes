NextJS 13

Pre-rendering
By default, NextJS pre-renders every page. This means that NextJS generates HTML for each page in advance, instead of having it all done by client-side JavaScript.
Each generated HTML is associated with minimal JavaScript code necessary for that page. When a page is loaded by the browser, its JavaScript code runs and makes the page
fully interactive. This process is called hydration.

Two forms of pre-rendering
- Static Generation: The HTML is generated at build time and will be reused on each request.
- Server-side rendering: The HTML is generated on each request.

Routing
- Pages
Create a new folder in the app directory and name this new folder with the desired route name
Example: /about
Now add a page.tsx file inside this directory and the jsx inside this page will be rendered when we navigate to this route.

- Layouts
If you want to add a layout to a page, just add another file called layout.tsx in the same folder and the page will be rendered as a child of this layout.
Each route can have its own layout.tsx file if necessary.

To navigate between pages import the Link component from "next/link"
<Link href="/">Link to Home Page</Link>

To create dynamic routes
First create a folder with the following naming convention
[id]
Within the [id] folder, create a page.tsx. You will be able to access the id value within the page.

Sometimes we may want to group certain folders under one category but don't want that category to be a part of the route
Then we create a new folder like this (auth)
dashboard/(auth)/login
dashboard/(auth)/register

Both login and register folders are inside the (auth) folder. But when we naigate to the login page our url will not have (auth)
dashboard/login
