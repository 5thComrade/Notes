DynamoDB is a fully-managed, NoSQL database provided by Amazon Web Services.

When to use DynamoDB?
  - Hyper-scale applications
  - Hyper-ephemeral compute (aka serverless) DynamoDB is perfect for applications that are serverless.

Core Concepts in DynamoDB
  - Table
    It is a grouping of records that conceptually belong together.
  - Item
    An item is a single record in a DynamoDB table. It is comparable to a row in a relational database or a document in MongoDB.
  - Attributes
    A DynamoDB item is made up of attributes, which are typed data values holding information about the element.
    When you write an item to DynamoDB, each attribute is given a specific type. There are ten different data types in DynamoDB. Itâ€™s
    helpful to split them into three categories:
      - Scalars: Scalars represent a single, simple value, such as a username(string) or an age(number). There are 5 scalar types:
                 string, number, binary, boolean and null.
      - Complex: Complex types are the most flexible kind of attribute, as they represent groupings with arbitrary nested attributes.
                 There are two complex types: lists and maps.
      - Sets: Sets are a powerful compound type that represents multiple, unique values. They are similar to sets in your favorite programming language. 
              Each element in a set must be the same type, and there are three set types: string sets, number sets, and binary sets.
