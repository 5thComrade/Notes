nginx [engine x] is an HTTP and reverse proxy server, a mail proxy server, and a generic TCP/UDP proxy server.

Installing nginx on Mac
brew install nginx

To locate where nginx config file is installed on your machine
nginx -t

To check for help commands
nginx -h

The config file for nginx is
nginx.conf

To start nginx just run the following command in the terminal
nginx

Visit localhost:8080 to view the default html file served by nginx

To stop nginx
nginx -s stop
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The nginx config file has key value pairs
Each key-value pair is called a directive.

Each directive is inside a context(the block in curly braces)

events { ------------------------------- context
    worker_connections: 1024; ---------- directive
}

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Serving static content

Create a html file wherever you want in your machine.
Name the html file as index.html

In the nginx.conf file lets add the contexts and directives

http {
    server {
        listen 8080;                                -------- listen to port 8080
        root /Users/antony.chiramel/someFolder;     -------- serve whatever is there in someFolder, if there is an index.html file that will get served
    }
}

Once the configuration is set lets start nginx
Command
nginx

We will not see the new html file, we will see the default. We need to reload nginx
Command
nginx -s reload

Now refresh localhost:8080 you will see the new html page.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MIME Types

Now lets say you have a css file in someFolder(the folder that is getting served by nginx)
You have imported the css file in your html and you've also styled some elements.

However, when we navigate to localhost:8080 and refresh the page, we do not see the styles getting applied.
We inspect the network tab and we are able to see styles.css is actually getting served by nginx. So where is the problem?

The problem is MIME type of the css file.
If we inspect the file closely in the network tab, we see the Content-Type of the css file is text/plain not text/css.
We can fix this by adding the types context inside the http context

http {
    types {
        text/css    css; -------- files with css extension is of type/css
        text/html   html; ------- files with html extension is of type/html
    }

    server {
        listen 8080;                                -------- listen to port 8080
        root /Users/antony.chiramel/someFolder;     -------- serve whatever is there in someFolder, if there is an index.html file that will get served
    }
}


There are a ton of MIME types and we cannot it and type each and every type.
This is why nginx comes with default mime types.
In the same folder as your nginx.conf you'll see another file call mime.types
This file holds the mime types for all the common files. We just need to include this in our config

http {
    include mime.types;                             -------- include the default mime types file

    server {
        listen 8080;                                -------- listen to port 8080
        root /Users/antony.chiramel/someFolder;     -------- serve whatever is there in someFolder, if there is an index.html file that will get served
    }
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Location block
If we want to serve specific files when we hit specific endpoints we need to use the location context.
Ex: If you want to serve the index.html file inside the fruits directory(localhost:8080/fruits) we need the location context

http {
    include mime.types;                             -------- include the default mime types file

    server {
        listen 8080;                                -------- listen to port 8080
        root /Users/antony.chiramel/someFolder;     -------- serve whatever is there in someFolder, if there is an index.html file that will get served

        location /media {
            root /Users/antony.chiramel/someFolder; -------- same root? wtf? Yeap, nginx will automatically append /media(location name) to the root
        }
    }
}

If you don't want the location to be appended to the root, we can use alias

http {
    include mime.types;                             -------- include the default mime types file

    server {
        listen 8080;                                -------- listen to port 8080
        root /Users/antony.chiramel/someFolder;     -------- serve whatever is there in someFolder, if there is an index.html file that will get served

        location /media {
            root /Users/antony.chiramel/someFolder; -------- same root? wtf? Yeap, nginx will automatically append /media(location name) to the root
        }

        location /video {
            alias /Users/antony.chiramel/someFolder/media; -------- we used alias for /video location which will serve the same files as /media
        }
    }
}

Lets say we want to serve a folder which doesn't have an index.html file but instead has something.html file.
How do we handle this?

location /something {
    root /Users/antony.chiramel/someFolder;
    try_files /something/something.html /index.html =404; --------- try to find something.html if it doesn't file serve the index.html from the original root instead
}                                                                   if the root index.html also doesn't exisit, throw 404

We can also add regex for location names

location ~* /count/[0-9] {
    root /Users/antony.chiramel/someFolder;
    try_files /index.html =404;
}

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Redirects and Rewrites

location /redirect {
    return 307 /video; -------------------- 307 is the http status code for redirect and /redirect will redirect us to /video location
}                                           but after the redirect, your url will be localhost:8080/video not localhost:8080/redirect

If you don't want the url to change but only want the content from the redirect path we need to use rewrite

server {
    listen 8080;
    root /Users/antony.chiramel/someFolder;

    rewrite ^/number/(\w+) /count/$1; ------------ whenever you visit /number/4 you will be served the content from /count/4 but the url will still be /number/4

    location ~* /count/[0-9] {
        root /Users/antony.chiramel/someFolder;
        try_files /index.html =404;
    }
}

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Load Balancer
Lets say we have multiple servers doing the same stuff.
How will the client know which server to hit cause there are like 3 servers in total.
That is where the boss, nginx comes into picture.
The client sends the request to nginx and then nginx will send it to one of the servers acting like a load balancer.

nginx follows the round-robin algorithm to send requests to multiple servers. First it sends the request to server 1, the next request will not be sent to server 1
but instead it will be sent server 2 and so on and so forth.

Lets say you have an express server running in a docker container on port 7777.
We can map this container port ie 7777 to 1111, 2222, 3333 and 4444 on our machine.
Now we have the express server running on 4 different ports on the same machine, creating a feel its 4 different servers for our nginx to hit on

http {
    upsteam backendserver { ------------ upstream name
        server 127.0.0.1:1111; --------- all the server endpoints endpoints
        server 127.0.0.1:2222;
        server 127.0.0.1:3333;
        server 127.0.0.1:4444;
    }

    server {
        listen 8080;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backendserver/; -------- the upstream name for our servers
        }
    }
}
