Cloud Computing

- Cloud Computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources with pay-as-you-go pricing model.

- Deployment Models of the Cloud
* Private Cloud - Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public. Example: Rackspace
* Public Cloud - Cloud resources owned and operated by a third party cloud service provider delivered over the internet. Example: AWS, Azure
* Hybrid Cloud - Keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the cloud.

5 characteristics of cloud computing
- On-demand self-service
- Broad network access
- Multi-tenancy and resource pooling
- Rapid elasticity and scalability
- Measured service

6 advantages of cloud computing
- Reduced Total Cost of Ownership(TCO) and Operational Expense
- Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
- Scale based on actual measured usage
- Increase speed and agility
- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
- Go global in minutes

Types of Cloud Computing
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)

On-Premises --> Applications, Data, Runtime, Middleware, OS, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking
IaaS ---------> Applications, Data, Runtime, Middleware, OS (Example: AWS EC2, Azure, Digital Ocean)
PaaS ---------> Applications, Data (Example: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku, Google App Engine)
SaaS --------->

How to choose an AWS Region?
- Compliance with data governance and legal requirements.
- Proximity to customers
- Available services within a region
- Pricing

A region is comprised of multiple availability zones

Shared Responsibility Model
- Customer is responsible for - Security in the cloud, it's customer data, platform, IAM, OS, Network and Firewall configuration
- AWS is responsible for - Security of the cloud, hardware, regions etc

===========================================================================================================================
IAM - Identity and Access Management

When you create an AWS account, you are actually creating a root account. One should never use the root account.
Create users/groups within IAM with restricted access. Users/groups can be assigned IAM policies. These policies define the permissions
of the users. In AWS you apply the least privilage principle, don't give more permissions than a user needs.

To login as an IAM user, you need the AWS account id/AWS account alias, user-id, and password. If MFA is enabled, even MFA key.

Always set a Password Policy for all IAM users to ensure good security.

MFA - Multi Factor Authentication
MFA device options
1: Virtual MFA device(Google Authenticator, Authy)
2: Universal 2nd Factor(U2F) Security device (YubiKey by Yubico) - this is a physical key
3: Hardware Key Fob MFA device
4: Hardware Key Fob MFA device for AWS GovCloud(US)

MFA can be set under "My Security Credentials" page
