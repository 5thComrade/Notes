Cloud Computing

- Cloud Computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources with pay-as-you-go pricing model.

- Deployment Models of the Cloud
* Private Cloud - Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public. Example: Rackspace
* Public Cloud - Cloud resources owned and operated by a third party cloud service provider delivered over the internet. Example: AWS, Azure
* Hybrid Cloud - Keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the cloud.

5 characteristics of cloud computing
- On-demand self-service
- Broad network access
- Multi-tenancy and resource pooling
- Rapid elasticity and scalability
- Measured service

6 advantages of cloud computing
- Reduced Total Cost of Ownership(TCO) and Operational Expense
- Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
- Scale based on actual measured usage
- Increase speed and agility
- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
- Go global in minutes

Types of Cloud Computing
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)

On-Premises --> Applications, Data, Runtime, Middleware, OS, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking
IaaS ---------> Applications, Data, Runtime, Middleware, OS (Example: AWS EC2, Azure, Digital Ocean)
PaaS ---------> Applications, Data (Example: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku, Google App Engine)
SaaS --------->

How to choose an AWS Region?
- Compliance with data governance and legal requirements.
- Proximity to customers
- Available services within a region
- Pricing

A region is comprised of multiple availability zones

Shared Responsibility Model
- Customer is responsible for - Security in the cloud, it's customer data, platform, IAM, OS, Network and Firewall configuration
- AWS is responsible for - Security of the cloud, hardware, regions etc

===========================================================================================================================
IAM - Identity and Access Management

When you create an AWS account, you are actually creating a root account. One should never use the root account.
Create users/groups within IAM with restricted access. Users/groups can be assigned IAM policies. These policies define the permissions
of the users. In AWS you apply the least privilage principle, don't give more permissions than a user needs.

To login as an IAM user, you need the AWS account id/AWS account alias, user-id, and password. If MFA is enabled, even MFA key.

Always set a Password Policy for all IAM users to ensure good security.

MFA - Multi Factor Authentication
MFA device options
1: Virtual MFA device(Google Authenticator, Authy)
2: Universal 2nd Factor(U2F) Security device (YubiKey by Yubico) - this is a physical key
3: Hardware Key Fob MFA device
4: Hardware Key Fob MFA device for AWS GovCloud(US)

MFA can be set under "My Security Credentials" page

How to access your AWS?
1: AWS Management Console (protected by password + MFA)
2: AWS Command Line Interface: CLI (protected by access keys)
3: AWS Software Development Kit: SDK - for code (protected by access keys)

You could install AWS CLI from aws on your system, open command prompt and run the following command to verify the installation.
aws --version

If you have permission issues (like I have on my company laptop), you can use AWS CloudShell 
This is a browser simulation of a command prompt which has aws cli, node and other things pre-installed.
You can practice your cli skills on it.

- IAM Roles
Some AWS service will need to perform actions on your behalf.
Ex: If Lambda needs to reach out to S3, lambda needs permissions, these permissions are called IAM Roles

- IAM Security tools
1: IAM Credentials Report (account-level)
2: IAM Access Advisor (user-level)

-IAM Best Practices
1: Do not use the root account, except for AWS account setup
2: One Physical user = One AWS user
3: Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups
4: Create a strong password policy
5: Use and enforce MFA
6: Create and use Roles for giving permissions to AWS services
7: Use Access Keys for Programmatic Access (CLI/SDK)
8: Audit permissions of your account with IAM Credentials Report

- IAM Shared Responsibility Model
AWS - Infrastructure, Configuration and Vulnerability analysis, compliance validation
YOU - Users, Groups, Roles, Policies and monitoring

AWS Budget Setup

For billing information, navigate to "My Billing Dashboard"
By default IAM users do not have access to billing information.
The access needs to be given by the root user by activating "Activate IAM Access", this will ensure that users who are admins have access to billing information.

One can setup a budget and a budget threshold for your aws usage and aws will notify you when the expense reaches the threshold.
