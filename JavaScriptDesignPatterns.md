# JavaScript Design Patterns - Book

These are my personal notes from a book I read about JavaScript Design Patterns.

## Chapter 1. Introduction to Design Patterns

"Good code is like a love letter to the next developer who will maintain it!"

A pattern is a reusable solution template that you can apply to recurring problems and themes in software design.

Learning and using design patterns is mainly advantageous for developers because of the following:

- Patterns are proven solutions.
    
    They are the result of the combined experience and insights of developers who helped define them. They are time-tested approaches known to work when solving specific issues in software development.

- Patterns can be easily reused.

    A pattern usually delivers an out-of-the-box solution you can adopt and adapt to suit your needs. This feature makes them quite robust.

- Patterns can be expressive.

    Patterns can help express elegant solutions to extensive problems using a set structure and a shared vocabulary.

- Patterns assist in preventing minor issues that can cause significant problems in the application development process.

- Patterns provide generalized solutions, documented in a fashion that doesn’t require them to be tied to a specific problem.

- Some patterns can decrease the overall code file-size footprint by avoiding repetition.

- Patterns add to a developer’s vocabulary, which makes communication faster.

- Popular design patterns can be improvised further by harnessing the collective experiences of developers using those patterns and contributing back to the community.
