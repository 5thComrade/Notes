What is Github Actions?
It is a Workflow automation service offered by GitHub. Automate all kinds of repository-related processes and actions.
GitHub Actions works well with CI/CD.
Continuous Integration(CI): code changes are automatically built, tested and merged with existing code.
Continuous Delivery(CD): After integration, new app or package versions are published automatically.
Github Actions can also help in code & repository management.

A Github repository can have
1: Workflows: A repo can have as many workflows it wants. Workflows are triggered upon events.
2: Jobs: A workflow can have one or more jobs. A job defines a Runner(execution environment). Jobs can run in parallel(default) or sequential.
3: Steps: A job can then have one or more steps. Execute a shell script or an action.
