Software Product Management

Three viewpoints in achieving better software
1: The right product
2: Done right

How to measure project success?

2: was the project within the budget
3: was the project meeting the specifications
4: developer satisfaction
5: post-release bugs
6: support needed after release
7: customer rating
8: revenue generated

Four values of Agile
1: Individuals and Interations > Processes and Tools
   As a product manager, you need to facilitate communication between the people wanting the product 
   and the people producing the product.
2: Working Software > Comprehensive Documentation
3: Customer Collaboration > Contract Negotiation
   As a product manager, you need to foster a positive relationship with your customer that is more concerned with what 
   they want and not as concerned with what is laid out in some contract.
4: Responding to change > following a plan
